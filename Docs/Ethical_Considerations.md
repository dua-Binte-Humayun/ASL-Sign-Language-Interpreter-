## Ethical Considerations

This project adheres to ethical principles relevant to AI-based assistive systems, particularly those designed for vulnerable or marginalized user groups.

Key ethical considerations include:

### Accessibility and Inclusivity
The system is designed to reduce communication barriers without replacing human interpreters. It is intended as an assistive tool, not a substitute for professional care or support.

### Privacy
No personal or identifiable data is stored permanently. All video input is processed locally during runtime to ensure user privacy and data protection.

### Bias and Fairness
The project acknowledges that limited datasets may not fully represent all hand shapes, skin tones, or signing styles. Future work will focus on diversifying training data to reduce bias and improve generalization.

### Transparency
System limitations are clearly communicated. The model does not claim perfect accuracy, and users are informed of potential recognition errors.

### Responsible Use
The system is not intended for critical medical diagnosis or legal interpretation without human verification.

Ethical AI development is treated as a continuous process, and future iterations will incorporate user feedback and ethical review.
