## Research Context

This project is positioned at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Accessibility. The core objective is to explore how intelligent vision-based systems can improve communication accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.

Sign language interpretation remains a major challenge in inclusive system design, particularly in healthcare and educational environments where immediate communication is critical. Traditional solutions often rely on human interpreters, which may not always be available. This motivates the need for AI-driven assistive technologies that can function in real time and adapt to user needs.

From an HCI perspective, the project investigates how users interact with AI systems designed for accessibility. Emphasis is placed on usability, feedback, system transparency, and minimal cognitive load. The system is designed not only for accuracy, but also for user comfort and trust.

This research aligns with ongoing work in:
- Accessible Human-Computer Interaction
- Intelligent sensing systems
- Assistive and healthcare-oriented AI applications
- Ubiquitous computing environments

The project serves as a foundation for future research on intelligent, inclusive, and context-aware interaction systems.
