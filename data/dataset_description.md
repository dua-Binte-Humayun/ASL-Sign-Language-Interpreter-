## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of static images representing American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets.

### Data Sources
- Publicly available ASL datasets
- Self-collected samples for controlled testing

### Preprocessing
- Image resizing
- Background normalization
- Noise reduction
- Grayscale conversion where applicable

### Limitations
- Focused on static gestures only
- Limited signer diversity
- Dynamic gestures not included

The dataset was selected to support exploratory research and proof-of-concept development rather than large-scale deployment.
