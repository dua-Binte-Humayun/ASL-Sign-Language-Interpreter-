## Inclusive Design Notes

Inclusive design was a core consideration throughout development.

Design decisions included:
- Clear visual feedback instead of audio-only cues
- Minimal reliance on fine motor precision
- Consistent layout and predictable interaction flow

Future improvements will include participatory design involving deaf users to further refine interaction models.
